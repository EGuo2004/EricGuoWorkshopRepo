- MongoDB is no sequel database
- no sequel database is storing organized data, but not in rows and cols
- Data is stored in documents
- Documents = way to store data in field value pairs - "name" : "Eric"
- Clusters are a group of servers storing data while a replica set stores duplicates of the data so if one machine goes down the rest still work
- C - data took a good while to load, not sure the reason or if thats normal
