Qina and Cameron were in the same group so their code was identical, their code was very similar to mine 
Their code was very understandable
random seemed to be the popular option to do the weighted results

Other Groups:
Yaying's group had reasonings behind why they did certain things which made me understand the thought process 
Han's group is very similar to my group 
Raymond's group was less compact with the code however had a very nice summary which was easier to read than comments, however were less informative about what specific code does.
