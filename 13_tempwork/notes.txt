We seem to prefer making multiple functions for clarity and simplicity.
The comments that we went with ended up being short, sweet and simple yet to the point which is probably for the best. However they are not overly descriptive. 
We seem to not use overly descriptive variable names (x, y) as it was fastrer since we did not have that many variables

EGO
Compared to my own code, the final code we went with used thresholds for the first parsing of the dictionary and as such did not need a second and would effectively be more efficient.
